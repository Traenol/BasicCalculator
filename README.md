# Week 3: Functions & Calculator
A simple CLI calculator to practice using DRY coding principles, multiple code files, and function handling.
The user enters a number, an operator, and another number, the program will procude the result. The user can then continue with further calculations, clear the current result, or close the calculator.

## Project Requirements

- One function per operation
- User selectes operation
- Minimize code duplication

## Secondary features

- Clear function
- Operation history
- Multi-step calculations

## Usage Instructions

- Must have Python3 installed
- Clone this repository
- run: python main.py

## What I learned

- How to properly pass functions as a variable
- Multiple return values
- Multiple code files and avoiding recursive imports
- 

## Example Usage

```
Welcome to my basic Calculator
Please enter a number.
1.7
Please select an operation. (+, -, *, /)*
Please enter a number.
8
1.7 times 8.0 is 13.6
```

## Future Improvements
- Higher math functions, such as exponents and square roots
- Help System
- Memory function
